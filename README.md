# Sensor_conditioning
 Projects developed during the signal conditioning course include a conveyor and bottle sorting band, as well as the construction of an automated greenhouse.

The bottle sorting project included capacitive and inductive proximity sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and an encoder to transport and select between plastic bottles and metal cans (or metallic bottles).


Greenhouse built with motion, humidity, temperature, water level sensors, and a photoresistor, programmed in Arduino.
